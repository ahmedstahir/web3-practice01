# Web3 Practice

<b>Step #1:</b>\
Read an account's ether balance on Ethereum Mainnet

<b>Step #2:</b>\
Read data from the ERC20 UNI token contract deployed on Ethereum Mainnet

<b>Step #3:</b>\
Transfer 0.1 ETH from one account to another on Ropsten Testnet

<b>Step #4:</b>\
Deployed a simple contract, on Ropsten Testnet, that has a `uint256` state variable and the following four functions:
- `setNumber` to set a specific value in the variable
- `increment` will increase the value of the variable by 1
- `decrement` will decrease the value by 1
- `getNumber` returns the current value

Address of the deployed contract is `0x5Bdc2d267058F861a609da09fB81a075395B520C`

<b>Step #5:</b>\
Calling functions of the smart contract deployed in previous step

<b>Step #6:</b>\
Read events from the ERC20 UNI token contract deployed on Ethereum Mainnet
